# Vegetation Studio Pro Extensions

Vegetation Studio Pro Extensions has been free for years and found excellent recognition. Thank you very much for using it, that's very motivating!

However extending it and supporting it takes its time which isn't possible anymore in my spare time alone. So I decided to move it to the Unity Asset Store. This way I can get a bigger audience, it's easier to download directly via Unity's Package Manger (which was a request by many users) and you get automatically notified about updates. Plus more importantly I can shift time to extend it even further.

You can get it here:
